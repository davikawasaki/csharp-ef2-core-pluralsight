"A comprehension is needed about how the data model is defined through the DbContext maps to the schema of the database. Then, it performs that logic runtime by reading the DbContext and using its own conventions combined with any additional custom mapping information provided to infer the schema of the database, being able to figure it out how to do those interactions; how to build queries to push data to the database; how to transform database results into .NET objects.","Entity Framework Core 2: Getting Started","Creating a Data Model and Database with EF Core","Understanding EF Core Migrations","0:40","https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=entity-framework-core-2-getting-started&author=julie-lerman&name=fa16ecc6-d374-4ad8-af7c-55632114f53a&clip=5&mode=live&start=40.074127&noteid=6321d6b5-3b70-4292-b686-7e3845cf42c6"

"Migration recommendation:\n1. For development databases, the command update-database should suffice, applying such changes leveraging the EF Core APIs directly (creates the database if it does not exist).\n2. For production databases, the command script-migration should run directly SQL generated queries, which can be manipulated by DBAs according to specific particularities of infrastructure and database logics and to when and how these executions need to be applied.","Entity Framework Core 2: Getting Started","Creating a Data Model and Database with EF Core","Using Migrations to Script or Directly Create the Database","1:02","https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=entity-framework-core-2-getting-started&author=julie-lerman&name=fa16ecc6-d374-4ad8-af7c-55632114f53a&clip=8&mode=live&start=62.209483&noteid=3f708856-f2b8-4327-962e-382291a287a2"
